									<h1>Unleashing its Potential of MS Excel </h1>
									<p>It all unfolded on an ordinary day when absorbed in his work, Manoranjan received a 
										call that would forever alter the course of his life. His wife, Lekha, suffered a 
										heart attack while tending to household chores, leaving their family in a state of panic. 
										With 5 adult members present in the family, chaos ensued as they scrambled to fight for the 
										life of Lekha. The wrenching truth is that Manoranjan had learned about CPR during mandatory 
										first aid training at his workplace, yet he couldn't pass this knowledge on to his family. 
										The profound impact of the gap between knowing and not knowing now shadows Manoranjan's existence.</p>

        Excel is conventionally known for its role in tabulated data analysis and pivot charts. However, it can be transformed into an interactive interface, akin to HTML+CSS+Javascript experiences. In this article, we explore three examples of Excel sheets that go beyond conventional tabular calculations and simplistic data visualization tools. These sheets are designed for engineering calculations and are easily reproducible, showcasing the multifaceted capabilities of Excel.

    <h2>1. Pump and Pipe Selection: Optimizing Flow Networks</h2>

    <p>
        This Excel sheet aids in selecting the optimal pump and pipe size for a given flow network. Yellow cells prompt user input, which can be provided through parametric input or dropdown selection. The sheet accommodates currency and electricity prices, with the flexibility to modify them according to specific requirements.

    <h2>2. Simpson Method for Earthwork Calculation: Efficient Volume Computation</h2>

    <p>
        The sheet employs the Simpson numeric method for volume calculation in earthwork (excavation or filling). Users input reduced initial and final levels, and subsequent sheets perform numeric calculations and other steps involved in numeric integration. The main sheet presents the final calculated value of net filling or excavated earth quantity.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Job Distribution and Bill of Quantity (BOQ): Strategic Work Allocation</h2>

    <p>
        This sheet facilitates job allocation to two contractors, dividing the job into six parts (A to F), each with four variants (T1 to T4). The three-tier job hierarchy involves different combinations and quantities of 25 BOQ items, with two payment rates upon completion.
